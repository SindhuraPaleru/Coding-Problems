You reached the front of the line as fast as you could. And now, you are about to buy the ticket to reach your hometown.

Oggy at the ticket counter gives you a schedule about the various ships. However, you also find Pikachu over there who gives a different map of secret routes that connect all the islands by road. And the distance between some islands is so small that you might as well walk it, instead of going by ship.


Now you are confused, how can you reach home really quickly?

You decide that you will take a mix of both routes. Some islands you will reach by walking, others by ship.

In Pikachu's map, the time taken between any island i and j is the absolute difference between i and j. So if there are are 5 islands, the walking time between them is:

From 1 to 2, time is 1 mins, to 3 the time is 2 mins and so on...
Similarly, the distance between 3 and 5 is 2 mins and so on...
Additionally, below is Oggy's map (via ships). It contains the time by ship between any 2  i and j

1 2 10
1 5 1
That is, there are 2 ships available. The ship between 1 and 2 takes 10 mins. But between 1 and 5 the time is 1 mins.

Thus, to reach 6, the best thing to do is to take a ship to 5 and then walk to 6

Taking your start point as 1 and end point as D, and given the schedule of N ships, you need to find the minimum time taken to reach home.

Note: You can only go forward, not backward.

Input format
The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases
The first line of each test case is D -  the destination
This is followed by N - the number of ship routes
After that, N lines of 3 numbers which signify start position, end position and time taken between the positions

Explanation
In the first case, the shortest path is to:
walk from 1 to 2: 1 minutes
ship from 2 to 5: 1 minutes
walk from 5 to 6: 1 minutes
Total: 3 minutes
In the second case, the best path is to:
walk from 1 to 3: 2 minutes
ship from 3 to 5: 2 minutes
walk from 5 to 6: 1 minutes
ship from 6 to 10: 1 minutes
Total: 6 minutes
