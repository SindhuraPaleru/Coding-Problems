Shinchan is overjoyed that you were able to clear the maze. Good job! His other friends haven't been so lucky. While you are on Party IslandTM  it seems everyone is enjoying themselves. Noddy doesn't look like he's heading back any time soon. You, on the other hand, want to get home to start practicing for the upcoming Edyst Web Development Course.

You meet Dora, the explorer, who says that there is a way back home using the ship. You've always wanted to experience a cruise - so you agree to follow her.

To get to the ship though, you need to cross a tunnel. The tunnel is very long and we will need flashlights to see in the dark.


Dora has a pack of N batteries.

Given a battery of certain rating Ai, the battery's power is the number of set bits in Ai
When two batteries Ai and Aj combine, their combined power becomes  Ai || Aj, where || is the bitwise OR operator
Dora had carefully packed the batteries such that the power of the entire set of batteries is just enough to help us cross the tunnel. However, now we need to remove some batteries, without hurting the overall power of the set of batteries, because we don't have enough space in the backpack.

Given a set of N battery ratings, choose the minimum number of batteries min such that the power of the min batteries is the same as power of N batteries.

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Ai <= 106
Input format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contain:
N followed by N numbers A1, A2, A3...... An

Explanation:

Case 1: we have powers: 3: 011, 5: 101, 7: 111, 13: 1101. Combining 13 and 7 will give us 15 : 1111, which is the same as the bitwise OR of entire batteries. Thus answer is 2 - only 2 batteries needed

Case 2: we need all 4 numbers to reach combined powers of  11110

Case 3: we only need 7 ( 111) to reach the same combined power as the entire batteries
